# 🔒 Liveness Detection Model

A real-time, deep learning-based liveness detection and face verification platform designed for secure, fast, and browser-based identity authentication — optimized for low-end devices and Aadhaar-ready!

---

## 🚀 Overview

Face recognition is powerful, but without liveness detection, it’s vulnerable to spoof attacks. This project aims to **bridge that gap** using an intelligent, full-stack solution:

- ✅ Detects whether a face is real or spoofed (photo/video attack)
- ✅ Enables secure Aadhaar face verification
- ✅ Runs directly in web browsers using TensorFlow.js
- ✅ Optimized for low-end devices

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🧬 **Deep Learning-Based Liveness Detection**  
  Built using TensorFlow and Keras with high accuracy in differentiating live faces from spoof attempts.

- 🌐 **Web Deployment via TensorFlow.js**  
  Real-time inference in the browser — no server round-trips, ensuring speed and privacy.

- ⚡ **Model Optimization**  
  Applied **quantization** and **pruning** to reduce model size by **30%** with zero compromise on accuracy.  
  Improved inference speed by **15%** on low-end devices.

- 🛡️ **Secure Face Verification Platform**  
  Full-stack implementation for Aadhaar-level authentication:
  - Backend powered by **FastAPI**
  - Face matching using a **ResNet model** achieving **92% accuracy**

- 👥 **Tested and Verified**  
  Deployed and tested with **30+ users** to evaluate spoof resistance and usability.
